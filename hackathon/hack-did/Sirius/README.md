1. Project name and its members: Mintia, Shivam Agarwal(@ShivamAgarwal-code)
2. Description: Mintia empowers artists and builders with a unique user experience that benefits them financially. Our AR/VR-enabled 3D NFTs offer immersive experiences for buyers and collectors. Builders can store and manage 3D models for seamless collaboration. We aim to revolutionize the art and construction industries.
Creator will create an original NFT that he will host on MINTIA after getting validated by an expert or institute.

He will be able to claim that it’s his Artwork after authenticating his wallet address by that given in the transaction address(which will be embedded in a QR-code in the artwork).

At the time of auction, the original NFT will be transferred from creator’s wallet to owner’s wallet. After then, the QR-code will be changed physically and now the current owner will be able to claim it.

I built the project using web3 technologies like smart contracts and uploading them on testnet for testing purposes on multiple blockchains like POlygon-zkEVM, 5ire and Dojima.

Hosted it on vercel using registry from GoDaddy domain names. I used odelviewer to show AR based NFTs for users to experience them in a dynamic way in mobile phone too.
3. Tag-line (if-any): A solution for authenticating art pieces through NFTs.Providing platform for artists to sell their 2D/3D artworks, with 3D assets view in AR/VR

5. Steps to follow for testing the project: This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
